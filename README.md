Twitter Network Analysis with NetworkX 

### Sarah and Celia's Todo list:

* C: NetworkX part1: nodes, edges, attributes:
* C: NetworkX part2: exporting and importing data:
    (exporting is good so that attendees can see what their end json-data processing format should look like)
* C: NetworkX part3: types of graphs:
    - undirected, directed

* ~~using NetworkX/matplotlib to plot stuff:~~ ... actually, this is covered in NetworkX, part 1
    - ~~C: basics: how to set edge and node sizes~~

* C: clean up PyTN retweet/status data, make simplier data manip scripts just for the tutorial

* the relevant Twitter API calls that we'll use to grab the data:
    * S: friends, followers
    * C: retweets, statuses
* how to get the json payloads, and get them into a format that NetworkX can import:
    * S: friends, followers
    * C: retweets, statuses
* using networkx & matplotlib to display data:
    * S: friends, followers
    * C: retweets, statuses

Twitter Stuff:
* ~~C how to get your Twitter API tokens~~
* ~~C: basic script to make the API calls~~
* C libs needed: oauth2

* S: installation instructions:
    - different ways of following along
    - libs needed for PyTN: networkx, json, malplotlib (warn that this takes a while)
    - libs needed for Twitter: oauth2 (can just put this on the Twitter post-tutorial ipynb)

If there's time:
* C: get last 20% of retweet data (but we'll be okay w/o it)
